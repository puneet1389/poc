ServiceInsight7,CH_129,"Users are locked out frequently requiring assistance in e-mailing service desk for unlocks and submitting new passwords, etc. Then, due to the changes in passwords, they are likely to lock themselves out again. I understand this is largely an ""end-user"" issue, but it is a recurring issue at many sites. Perhaps lowering the threshold for the password would be helpful. A 4-digit pin is easier and more manageable for technicians than intricate password requirements (which inevitably are written down in a handy location so they can remember it thus defeating any security provided by an intricate password).  Streamlining the password / unlock request process. Is it necessary to have to contact support? Could this process not be automated using the technicians e-mail or other two factor authentication? This would eliminate the requirement to e-mail or call support. And theoretically (and I hate to sound like an MBA) but could cut costs for the service center or allow them to refocus their efforts to solving other issues.  Better access to associated PMs and WOs associated with assets and generated PM work orders. For me to look at the past PMs for a monthly generated work order, I have to go to the relevant WO, click on the equipment tab, click the equipment number, click on order history, then organize by date to find the older work orders. This is not intuitive, and with the limited access frontline supervisors and managers have to search, reports, and equipment detail, it is not feasible to search assets and draw relevant information, history, etc.  On-site supervisors and manager don't have adequate control over PM generation and Asset management meaning we have to submit asset changes to our SI7 manager to make relevant changes. This is time consuming and takes the control from the individuals with the knowledge need to be inserted and creating an unnecessary middle step to the process.  Last, if there was a way in which work orders could be generated real-time on a monitor, it could be incredibly helpful. For our sites that used used TMS CMMS system, when a work order was generated it would automatically print the order on the shop printer and we would immediately know that a WO had come in. It also gave us a physical copy to hand to technicians for them to read the relevant details, complete the assigned task, then enter the completion info into CMMS. A similar system, printed or perhaps displayed on a monitor in work areas would allow such real-time acknowledgment of entered orders. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The not to exceed values are very low and waste time quoting fairly basic work that may exceed these low amounts.  Work orders are often unnecessarily delayed in getting to vendors.  The very limited specific reasons that can be used to extend work orders is a frustrating waste of time.  OTSR work orders need to be dealt with in a different way than other work orders which is confusing and often causes delays.

However until then quantum is not quite there yet and is more of a chase to keep up dated in a race against being called out by the global leaders for low compliance or low scores.

We had worked with UPS for almost 20 years without any issues ever until CBRE came along and threw a giant ass monkey wrench in the whole thing.  Micromanaging the hell out of certain types of vendors does NOT work.  We worked independently with UPS corporate, regional, and local CBM's for years without issue.  The nature of our work did not interfer with operations but was totally ancillary to their business as it related to environmental permit compliance work which basically had nothing to do with their daily business operations yet the work needed to be completed quarterly.  Thus we operated independently to help assist and keep them in compliance.  We ususally notified folks of when we would be onsite, but much of the work was weather dependent and not able to be scheduled in advance and thus we went onsite when we needed to be there.  We had first hand working relationships with many folks onsite including all CBMs, and regional PE folks, down to many of the mechanics at the shops.  People knew us by name and many times called us directly for assistance.  Having to go through CBRE as a third party was nothing but a giant pain in the ass that provided no additional help for anyone.  Now for local housekeeping contracts or something like that where the workers are hourly low wage then a third party manager makes sense.  For us a highly educated professionals who performed very specific tasks that CBRE did not understand in way it was nothing but a hassle.  Before we worked directly with out clients on both work and invoicing issues.  Having to go through the VAWS system only costs us lots of extra time and effort that did not benefit the client in any way and led to us greatly having to increase our prices to justify the hassle.  In the end we no longer do work for our clients who utilze CBRE because it was not worth the hassle and the corporate fat cats in charge signed a global contract with another global corporation.  In the end this did not help the clients compliance with their permits and compliance status with the States.  We had worked hard to develop a compliance system that worked and it kept our clients in compliance with the permits from EPA and State regulatory bodies.  CBRE came along and basically ruined it all.  So I hope you guys are happy with yourselves.  You need to stick with specific business segments that you know such as housekeeping and building maintenance contracts.  When it comes to other highly specific compliance activities you should leave it to other experts in the field.  ",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1

I literally do not understand why it is so complicated and segmented to submit invoice in fmPilot. Invoice submission should be simple with an uncomplicated setup and platform. This should include easy access to each field, previous invoices, and should not be separated in small blocks without even a full screen (why is the screen a small square in my screen?) There should be an obvious field for invoice submission, & for the Invoice Number, and amounts. I mean to create an invoice you select ""submit invoice"", so how do you submit the invoice once it has been created? I submit each invoice at least 4 times.... You have to search for each field and good luck getting back the next time. Try separating the dispatch/work from the final invoice submission. Two different departments perform the functions at almost all companies but fmPilot acts as if it is one function, one process, and one department handling it all.

I have had on multiple occasions where ive put together very large bids taking me over 30+ minutes and when i go to save it will like time out and ill loose everything from my quote and have to start over completely. The next thing i dislike is when I invoice a job, we have to wait for pending verification. Even though i have the invoice completed and submitted. I feel like if our invoice is already done, we shouldnt have to go back in again after verification status is complete, just to change the status again for our invoices submittal. When im done with a job, i invoice it and when the store verifies. That should be it, I shouldn't have to go change status again to submit our invoice. I forget about this all the time and it causes us more days waiting to be paid for our work. Or if we already have a signed work order, why do we have to wait up to 3 more days for the store to verify the work is done? If a Manager signed our work order, isn't that already verifying the works been complete? My last complaint would be when i get a work order with a DNE on it. I go out and look at the job to inspect and verify what all is needed to complete the scope. I dont get a MOD to sign the work order at that time, as i have the intent of doing the job. However, their have been times where i complete an inspection and get back to my office. I run the numbers for labor and material, realize i need a DNE increase and submit a quote. My quote doesnt get approved and i invoice for incurred. Then the invoice gets kicked back because i dont have a signed work order, this has happened at least 5-6 times. I dont think i should have to get a signature on a work order when we dont complete the scope thats detailed on the work order. I also shouldnt have to drive back out to a property for a signature, just for the cost of 1 trip charge. We have had to do this before as well and its more of a pain and takes more time to deal with it then what our trip charge is worth.

Finally, the authentication process that our key customers must go through for our key apps (webquote, FM Analytics, SI Request) will be different for each app even when we've already configured SSO for SI Request already.

The GUI of the system (even for the admins) doesn't include/prompt for all the variables needed to successfully create a vendor record.

Too many clicks - Have to click on File ID then Property information link to get to the property in VIEW - Billing is cumbersome with too many clicks…Why not integrate Appraiser Allocation and POD directly into Tops2 just as Assignment Review, Required Docs and Value conclusion are? That way we don't have to click back and forth between Tops2 and VIEW.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
